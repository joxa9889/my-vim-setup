# Neovim + lazy.nvim Setup

This is my Neovim configuration based on the video:

**Full Neovim Setup from Scratch (2025)**  
https://youtu.be/KYDG3AHgYEs?si=Wg880qwJDzXhlcqP

- Uses lazy.nvim for plugin management
- Configured LSP, Telescope, Treesitter, and more
- Modular Lua config for easy customization

Getting started:

1. Install Neovim 0.10+
2. Clone this config to `~/.config/nvim`
3. Open Neovim and run `:Lazy sync`
4. Use Mason to install LSP servers/tools

It took me 1+ Hour to write this README on NeoVim (But I wrote it in Neovim anyway)
